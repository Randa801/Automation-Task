Feature: Valid Login and Checkout Process
  Scenario: Login and complete checkout process
    Given I open the login page
    When I login with valid credentials "standard_user" and "secret_sauce"
    Then I should be navigated to the products page
    And I add the two most expensive products to the cart
    When I open the cart
    Then I should see the selected products
    When I proceed to checkout
    Then I should be on the checkout page
    When I fill the checkout form with "John" "Doe" and "12345"
    And I continue to the overview page
    Then I should see the correct total amount before taxes
    And I should be on the URL "https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html"
    When I finish the order
    Then I should see the order confirmation message
